# dxmp-fe
A home grown music playing client thing that runs on React.

## Development

### Installation

You'll need node v6+. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Once you have that, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Developing

While developing, run the following to have the build environment watch for changes and rebuild:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Local Server

A small node webserver is bundled to serve built content while developing. To run:

```bash
npm run server
```

### Building

To create a full production build, run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```
